I also have been unable to see the most recent things my friends post without going to their page. That being said, after one of the most recent updates, feeds no longer load properly, and 90% of the time my feed and videos no longer load. You’re going downhill Facebook, only a matter of time before you go under. No customer support, hackers everywhere, more compromised accounts than not. Facebook has no support for people who’s accounts have been hacked, and when you report the hacked accounts, they tell you there’s nothing wrong with it. Never seen a more poorly run company in my life.",

It keeps getting in the way and popping up when i try to search ya know, actual instagram. If i wanted to Ai generate images I would go to an Ai platform there’s just not need for it in Instagram. I also don’t understand why they changed how to view multi photo posts. The white dots were fine. This new tiny sliver of the next picture thing is both ugly and more confusing than just a bunch of dots in the bottom. The fact that instagram has not listened nor conducted user surveys before or after implementing these changes says a lot about the company and i am disappointed in what the app has become. These changes don’t make me want to recommend nor continuing using Instagram. I hope in the future they conduct more user testing and maybe use their brains for half a second before implementing useless changes to a once great app.",

When I finally fight the AI’s suggestions to “plan a historical trip” and view the hashtag I want to look at, it’s filled with top posts from popular accounts. It’s near impossible (without spending unreasonable amounts of time), to find any smaller creators or recent posts. What’s the point of a hashtag if people can’t view the content that’s *actively* being posted under it? This stifles and chance of small accounts being recognized and just encourages uniformity and unoriginal content. Everyone is forced to adopt what’s trendy because that’s the only way to pop up on explore. \n\nInstagram, like all social medias, has a history of awful choices aimed at manipulating people as much as possible and it’s getting harder and harder to care about these apps.

Instead of enhancing my experience, it's made my time on the app a constant frustration. The AI constantly interrupts my scrolling with invasive and irrelevant suggestions, making it feel like a nagging salesperson who won't take no for an answer.\n\nBut that's not even the worst part - the AI seems to be constantly monitoring and analyzing my every move, making me feel like I'm under surveillance. It's creepy and uncomfortable, and I feel like my privacy is being violated at every turn.\n\nThe final straw is that the AI is just plain bad at its job. The suggestions are often completely off-base, and the \"recommended\" accounts it pushes on me are either spammy or completely unrelated to my interests.\n\nOverall, Instagram/Meta's new AI feature is a disaster. It's invasive, annoying, and just plain terrible. I implore the developers to go back to the drawing board and rethink their approach - because this AI is a total waste of space.\n\nRating: 1/5 stars (and that's being generous)\n\nAnd it hit the nail on the head.",

We are able to be friend or foe or none, even in opinion - disagree or agree or none, maybe both! The ability to hate or love! Emotions are so raw & honest, that they will make you feel - especially in the reels! There, it has made me realize too that I may not be the smartest but I’m definitely not the stupidest, but I am just one person of these many users, oh how smart we are in our own ways it’s truly astonishing! Being unwilling to learn is very detrimental to the growth of our self reflection, no matter where we are or who we are, you can be assured to learn things here especially about people’s character, whether it benefits you or the opposite. Coming into this app you have to remember no one can make YOU be you, you are YOUER than you, that’s what YOU choose so don’t choose to be like them! Whether your experience is dissatisfying, relieving or golden, it all counts because all days are not the same, there will be some that make you feel love & some even hate. 😇🤍",
